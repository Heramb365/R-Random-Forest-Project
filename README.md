# R-Random-Forest-Project

In this project, we use the random forest algorithm for classification on a heart disease dataset from UCL.
Firstly, we cleaned the data by imputing values and converting the data into a form which R can understand.
83.5% of the Out of Bag (OOB) samples were correctly classified by the random forest.

From the graph, we can deduce that as the number of trees decreases the error rate but only upto a certain point.

Lastly, a multidimensional scaling plot(MDS) was plotted and it was found that the X-axis accounts for 47% of the variation in the distance matrix, while the Y-axis accounts for 14% of the variation in the distance matrix.
